# diffusion2D

## Instructions for students

Please follow the instructions in [pypi_exercise.md](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/03_building_and_packaging/pypi_exercise.md).

The code used in this exercise is based on [Chapter 7 of the book "Learning Scientific Programming with Python"](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-7-matplotlib/examples/the-two-dimensional-diffusion-equation/).

## Project description

This package contains a Python implementation of the 2D diffusion equation. The diffusion equation is a partial
differential equation that describes how a quantity (e.g., heat, particles, etc.) diffuses
through a medium.
